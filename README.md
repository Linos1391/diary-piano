## Introduction

I do lots of diaries, but then always think of how to keep it secure. I want a camouflage, such thing that is reliable, that only the owner can log in. BOOM! A diary that can disguise as a normal piano app. I searched on Play Store... To dissapointed. Eventually, I decide to make it myself.

P/S: Actually, I created this app while preparing for AP CSA Exam. Welp, now I understand nothing about Java...

- There is another button added on the top left (`?`) that transfers you to this Github site. Use it whenever you forget anything.
- There are 3 buttons shown on the top right:
  - (`DEL`): Delete the previous note.
  - (`DONE`): Confirm the combination.
  - (`X`): Cancel and return to piano layout.
- Press on a note to write in.
  - *Notice:* Note group is recorded chronically. I recommend using song that has one note at a time.
